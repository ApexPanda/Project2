## Description: 
We have created an application to find a service provider for your pet, create your own profile with sections showing your pets, be able to post about your pet, and to review the service providers.

## Motivation
We wanted to build an application to assist you in finding services available to your pet. This is also a way to connect with people in your area, with the profiles making that aspect more personal.

## Result 
Using each team members experience, we worked very well together to create an application that allows a pet owner to create their own profile, to find service providers for their pet, and to view their profiles as well. Our application connects pet lovers everywhere!

## Features:
Create an account/login to your own account 
Create your own profile 
Add pets to your profile 
Find a service provider based on the service they offer 
Go to their profile 
See their reviews or their pets

## Team Efforts and Individual Responsibilities 

###### Kayla Tryon
###### Github username: ApexPanda
###### Contributions: 
Encrypted the passwords when stored into the database, created the users table and seeds, added service providers/pet owners to the table later on, and created our custom API for retrieving information from the backend. 

###### Dominic Ojeda
###### Github username: dojeda1
###### Contributions: 
Designed the "Create an Account" page and connected it to the backend, designed and created the users profile pages and connected the pets and reviews on the profiles to the backend, designed the color scheme and background for the site.

###### Greg Olson
###### Github username: mountainflow
###### Contributions: 
Designed the logo, connected the "Login" with the backend, added the favicon for tabs, created the login modal, designed and created the services output page, and designed and created the home page. 

###### Emily Robinson 
###### Github username: emssslay
###### Contributions:
Setup login routes, API routes, pet routes and table, review routes and table, user routes and added to table. Also setup the models for each and validated the API was getting data from the database. 

## Challenges 
Some challenges that we faced were the MVC Framework, encrypting the passwords in the database and then decrypting them, 

## Improvements 
We would like this to be an application that uses location services. Right now, you can only search by which service you are looking for. We do show that persons location, but it could be any person in any place, you'll just see everyone. We would also like to connect to the google API to be able to add another feature where you could search for pet stores and for more info on parks. We would also like to add code coverage.

## Requirements for the Project:
Your project must:
Use a Node and Express Web Server;
Be backed by a MySQL Database an ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;
Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);
Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed;
Have a polished frontend / UI;
Have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm;
Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).
Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server, see Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md
